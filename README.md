## About Me

Hi there, My name is Wilder!
I'm located in Colombia and I studied at Henry to become a FullStack developer,
I'm very passionate about developing in such a way that it doesn't feel like work but a hobby for me,
I also enjoy getting into projects that can represent a challenge for me, helping me to develop my personal
knowledge in such a way that I can become a well/expert/advanced person and developer.
I started coding this year when I got interested in working from home and also have a full-time job that gives me professional improvement
And here I am now, glad that you are reading this, and hoping to get in contact with you! :) And any chance would not go waste ;)
